If you are upgrading from version lower than 2.2.1, please run the migration tool found at "Tools/Le Tai's Asset/Translucent Image/Migrate" on every Scene that contain them.

You can select every Scenes you have and choose "Open Scene Addictive" and run the tool only once.

Besure to run the tools only once, if you did more than 1, you can undo normally.

Changes might not show up immdiately, in that case just resize the scene view and it should update.
